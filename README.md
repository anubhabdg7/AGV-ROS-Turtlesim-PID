# AGV-ROS-Turtlesim-PID


This is a ROS task that I did for the task round of the [Autonomous Ground Vehicle Research Group](https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP). Im this task there is a node named as pid.py which applies a PID control on the turtlesim node and while taking it to a desired position. The tuning parameters for the PID control has been done inside the node pid.py. 

The following is an image of the working condition of the node:
